```

Replace the `[name-of-your-account]` with your Github username. For example, if my username is `chungquantin`, I would do the below command to clone the repository to my local device.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/openguild-labs/frame-challenges.git
```

- Step 4: Edit the `README.md` file to register for official participation

Go to **Participant Registration** section and register to be the workshop participants. Add the below to the list, replace any placeholder with your personal information.

```
| ðŸ¦„ | Hermanto | Github slabgames | Game Developer |
```

- Step 5: `Commit` your code and push to the forked Github repository

```
git add .
git commit -m "Register for OpenGuild FRAME Challenges"
```

- Step 6: Create a `Pull Request` to merge your changes to this repository and name your PR as `Your name | Register for OpenGuild FRAME Challenges`

## Challenge Overview

After learning about Substrate, FRAME, Runtime, and Pallets in Polkadot SDK, this coding challenge helps you understand how these components work together by implementing a simplified version of the actual architecture.

### Key Concepts:

- **FRAME Pallets**: Libraries for building Substrate runtime, including core frame components and functional pallets
- **Runtime**: A collection of FRAME pallets that define blockchain logic

### Project Structure

This challenge simulates three core components:
- `system.rs`: Foundation module similar to `frame_system`
- `staking.rs`: Token staking module similar to `pallet_staking`
- `governance.rs`: On-chain proposal system similar to `pallet_collective` or `pallet_democracy`

### Runtime Configuration

The project defines a simplified runtime that configures concrete types for the generic pallets:

```rust
pub struct Runtime;

impl SystemConfig for Runtime {
    type AccountId = u64;
}

impl StakingConfig for Runtime {
    type Balance = u64;
}

impl GovernanceConfig for Runtime {
    // No additional types needed
}
```
